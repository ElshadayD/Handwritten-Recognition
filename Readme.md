# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MLP

A simple example of using a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from scikit-learn for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

This code demonstrates the use of scikit-learn's MLPClassifier to perform handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. The MLP model is trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated on a test set.
